# HTTP vs WebSockets performance

This is an experiment to compare HTTP vs WebSockets performance using `Python server` <==> `Nodejs client`. The idea is to find the best team to later on build AI agents on top of them.

I wrote an article about it in [Medium](https://medium.com/@jscriptcoder/http-vs-websocket-protocols-with-nodejs-clients-and-python-servers-3c830d703cbd)
